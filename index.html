      <h1>Hybrid Twins</h1>
      <p> a project to develop a hierarchical and distributed hybrid twin to support urban traffic management systems while leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), edge cloud computing, and next generation communication networks. A hybrid twin consists of a virtual (i.e., existing traffic simulation) and a digital twin, which integrate physics-based models and assimilate data acquired from infrastructure and in-vehicle sensors for traffic modeling, prediction, and management. The foundational research contributions are data analytics and machine learning including real-time learning for control. The traffic management system will be validated and evaluated via computer simulation and experimentation in the NSF PAWR COSMOS city-scale wireless testbed that is being deployed in West Harlem next to the Columbia campus. This unique urban testbed will provide a realistic environment for the system design and evaluation process, and will also serve as a platform for local community outreach.
